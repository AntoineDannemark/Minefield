# Minefield

A minefield game coded in vanilla JS at the begining of my Becode studentship.

## Getting started

This project is deployed on GithubPages at the following adress: https://antoinedannemark.github.io/Minefield/

## Features

A normal minefield game, with three difficulty levels and fully customizable grid size.

## Bugs

After playing the first game, the level selection menu gets rendered on the bottom of the page.

Also please note that the code of this project is really inefficient and that the CSS animations 
might give a hard time to your browser.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are welcome, however the code of this project is a mess and I will 
soon deploy a newer, more efficient and cleaner version with React.

## Licensing

The (bad) code in this project is licensed under MIT license.
