# Minefield

A minefield game coded in vanilla JS at the begining of my Becode studentship.

## Getting started

This project is deployed on GithubPages at the following adress: https://antoinedannemark.github.io/Minefield/

## Features

A normal minefield game, with three difficulty levels and fully customizable grid size.
Please note that the code of this project is really inefficient and that the CSS animations 
are giving a hard time to your browser.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are welcome, however the code of this project is a mess and I will 
soon deploy a newer, more efficient and cleaner version with React.

## Licensing

The (bad) code in this project is licensed under MIT license.
